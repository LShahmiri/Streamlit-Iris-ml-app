# Iris Flower Prediction App

This Streamlit application predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user-provided measurements.  
It uses a simple machine learning model trained on the classic Iris dataset from the `scikit-learn` library.

## What the Code Does

- Loads the built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn  
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset  
- Provides an interactive user interface to input flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width)  
- Predicts the Iris flower species based on the entered parameters  
- Displays prediction probabilities for each class  

## What the Code Does Not Do

- It does not save user input or model data  
- It does not perform hyperparameter tuning or advanced model training  
- It does not require an internet connection or any external data source  

## Installation
